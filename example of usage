example:
input:
3 4
4 3 4 1 2
1 4
1 4
output:
2


description:
input:
3 4         <== respectively left and right partition(i.e digit 3 means there are 3 vertexes on left partition) 
4 3 4 1 2   <== first number means amount of potential matches for first vertex and next numbers represent vertexes from right partition
1 4         <== same as above i.e 1.potential match with vertex '4'
1 4         <== the same
output:
2           <== maximum number of matches
